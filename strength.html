                      Strength is an outdoor athletics brand that markets towards the upper population. For this project, I started by writing down things that made me think of strength and fitness. Next I wrote down things that would relate to such, for example, dumbells, but those are generic so I moved onto other possible imagery. I ended up deciding on bears for what they symbolize (strength, courage, tenacity) and people’s impressions on bears (adaptable, warm, comfortable). Based around the first two symbols, I brainstormed a few designs and chose the one that fit the company the best. With this final decision, I worked with different colours and shapes for the design of the logo. With the logo complete, I worked on the copy and tagline. I wanted to incorporate the word “adapt” and the idea of courage and adventure. With the copy I wanted to get across the comfort and quality of the brand. After completeing the ad, I worked on the business card, starting with the plan of a double sided printed card. I planned to put the logo in the front, centered and simple, but clean. With that, I put the contact information in the back and incorporated the trees from the bear logo as the background and bear paws to lead the eye through the list. After completeing the card I started on the letterhead, to make it like the rest of the designs, I used a similar layout as the back of the business card, using the trees as a background. Lastly, for the envelope, I used the same layout as the letterhead, and a blank rectangle to imply the placement of clear plastic where you will see the mailing address and name of the recipient. Throughout this design I chose two colours, grey and green. The grey is used to apply contrast against the white and to allow the green to pop. The green is a colour people relate to nature and symbolizes renewal, freshness, ambition, safety, and nature. Overall the colour green and the bear symbolically represents what the company is and represents.
