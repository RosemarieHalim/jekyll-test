        The Atelier Fashion Show is organized annually by the St. Clair College Fashion Design Techincian Program to present the students' designs and to promote the students to potential professions in the fashion design field. The theme of this event was a fairytle forest with green as the main colour and pantone of the year (living coral) as the complimentary colour. The decor that will be used for this event will be vines, candles, wood, mist, and fairy lights. My take on the theme was a whimsical and mysterious style, focusing on the mist and greenery incorporated with the set. The main focus for the poster is the model and a drawn in mist that would add a sense of surrealism and allow flexible movement flow through the poster. The type was placed in a grid-like layout but the typography gave the type some breathing room but made use of white space in an effective way to allow clear readability. For the advertiser package, the elements from the poster were used to maintain unity with the other designs. Similarily, the tickets used the same elements from the poster, but the type was used more loosely, allowing it to feel more fluid and flow around the image. For the tear-off part of the ticket, the mist was used as a background and the black box helped give some contrast to the logo and ticket overall. As for the social media ads, they were designed similarily to the ticket, with the type flowing around the image and allowing the model or mist to be the centerpiece. Throughout the entire design, the colours and elements remained the same to maintain consistency and unity to allow people to recognize the posters and associate them to the event.
