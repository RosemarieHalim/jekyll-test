                Motley is an photography brand that markets towards the Millenial and Generation Z Audience. The process of designing this layout began with brainstorming the typefaces and images that would match the atmosphere of the brand. The title "Motley" routes to the direct definition of the word that means exhibiting great diversity of elements or being of different colors combined. The style of the brand is based off artistic pop culture and uses vibrant colours. The greatest difficulty making this layout was working with the type and images to feel combined and maintaining the readability of the content. To finalize the design, the typeface was repetitively used throughout the layout to keep consistency and maintain a sense of harmony.
