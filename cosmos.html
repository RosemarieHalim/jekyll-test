                    Cosmos is a Graphic Design company. The decision to the name "Cosmos" was to leave an impression that their work is "out of this world". The process to designing this web design started with brainstorming the company and its target. The logo is an astronaut to maintain the meaning behind the company and the slogan. After deciding the colour pallette and logo design, the home page was designed and created. The decision to weave the title around the astronaut was to emphasize and bring dimension to the astronaut. The overall design of the website is a scroll webpage with the header holding links to instantly scroll to the section the reader clicks on. The hamburger menu uses an overlay which similarily can display the different sections, but can also have more links for other information about the company. For the phone design layout, the hamburger menu will contain the hyperlinks to the other sections rather than shrinking down to an unreadable size on the header. The following sections and icons are vector based, and a sans serif typeface was used to keep the modern style consistent throughout the design. The greatest difficulty in this process was rearranging the content but keeping it consistent and recognizable throughout the different layouts. To maintain a sense of unity, the same colours were used for the layout and the icons remained encased within a circle. Overall the design portrays the quality and characteristics of the company, maintaining a clean and easy to read layout.
